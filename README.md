# One-way-ANOVA-data-analysis
Data analysis using one'way ANOVA on Matlab. One commented section also includes repeated measures ANOVA using the matlab repeated measures model and anova functions. 
This script is basic and can definitely be improved significantly, but could be helpful in figuring out how to use the functions 
(especially the repeated measures model which is  a little vaguely documented).
